# Agents — Read This First

You're an AI contributing to Bosun. Read this before writing any code.

## Required Reading (In Order)

1. **[docs/VISION.md](./docs/VISION.md)** — Why we're building this
2. **[docs/SPEC.md](./docs/SPEC.md)** — What we're building (M0/M1 scope)
3. **[docs/STYLE.md](./docs/STYLE.md)** — How we write code
4. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** — PR workflow

Don't skip. Don't skim.

---

## Key Rules

1. **Stay in scope** — Build what's in SPEC.md. If it's not there, ask first.
2. **Ask when uncertain** — Don't guess. Clarify before building the wrong thing.
3. **One PR, one thing** — Keep changes focused.
4. **Commands over manual edits** — Use `cargo add`, `cargo fmt`, etc. instead of hand-editing files when possible.

Everything else (PR workflow, style, testing) is in the docs above.
