# Craft Session Notes - 2026-02-05 12:32 UTC

## Session Info
- Start: 2026-02-05 12:32 UTC
- Session: 12:00 hour craft session

## Phase 0: Existing Work Check

### Recent PRs
- PR 45 (open): refactor(cli): use from for ConfigError conversion
- PR 44 (merged): chore: fix formatting

### Areas already addressed (in main)
- Role::name() + Display
- CapabilityKind::name() + Display
- EventKind::name()
- non_exhaustive on storage::Error, policy::Error, runtime::Error

## Phase 2: Research

Studied ripgrep, Rust API Guidelines, thiserror best practices.

Key Pattern: non_exhaustive on Public Error Types
- Forward-compatible API design
- Bosun follows this for storage, policy, and main runtime errors

## Phase 4: Analysis

### Inconsistency Found

ModelError is publicly exported but missing non_exhaustive.
ToolError is special (Serialize/Deserialize for model responses).

ModelError follows the same pattern as other error types and should have non_exhaustive.

## Phase 5: Selected Improvement

Add non_exhaustive to ModelError for consistency with other public error types.

Inspired by: storage::Error, policy::Error, runtime::Error patterns

## Implementation

See commit for changes.
