# Craft Session Notes — 2026-02-05 14:46 UTC

## Session Info
- **Start:** 2026-02-05 14:46 UTC
- **Session:** 14:00 hour craft session

## Phase 0: Existing Work Check

### Recent Open PRs (to avoid duplication)
- **PR #47 (open):** polish/runtime-crate-docs — Runtime crate documentation
- **PR #46 (open):** polish/model-error-non-exhaustive — ModelError #[non_exhaustive]
- **PR #45 (open):** polish/config-error-from-trait — ConfigError #[from] trait

### Existing Polish Branches (18 total)
All focus on: error handling, Display traits, name() methods, FromStr, module cleanup, etc.

### Areas Already Covered
- Error handling patterns ✓
- Display impls for enums ✓
- name() methods ✓
- FromStr implementations ✓
- Module organization ✓
- Runtime crate docs ✓ (PR #47)

### Gap Identified
**README.md is out of date:**
- Says "Status: Planning / Pre-development" (false — M0 is substantially complete)
- Says "Getting Started — Not yet implemented" (false — CLI works)
- Last updated at initial commit, never updated since

**Not addressed by any existing PR or branch.**

## Phase 2: Research

### Projects Studied

**ripgrep (BurntSushi)**
- Clear one-liner description
- Quick links to docs
- Examples showing capability
- Installation / Building sections

**eza**
- Modern, clean layout
- "Try it" section
- Installation instructions
- Command-line options

### Key Patterns
1. Accurate status — don't say "not implemented" when it works
2. Quick start instructions that actually work
3. Build from source section
4. Keep it scannable

## Phase 4: Analysis

### Current README Issues

1. **Status is wrong:** "Planning / Pre-development" but M0 is substantially complete:
   - CLI chat works ✓
   - Events persisted and viewable ✓
   - Runs show token usage + cost ✓
   - Side effects denied by default ✓
   - Policy file loaded and respected ✓

2. **Getting Started is wrong:** Says "Not yet implemented" but:
   ```bash
   $ bosun --help
   A local-first AI agent runtime
   
   Commands:
     chat      Start an interactive chat session
     sessions  List all sessions
     logs      Show event logs for a session
   ```

3. **No build instructions:** How do I actually run this?

## Phase 5: Selected Improvement

**Update README.md to reflect actual project state**

Changes:
1. Update status from "Planning / Pre-development" to "M0 Complete / Active Development"
2. Replace placeholder Getting Started with real instructions
3. Add "Building from Source" section
4. Update Milestones to show M0 checkmarks

**NOT changing:**
- Overall structure (it's good)
- Vision/documentation links
- License info

**Inspired by:**
- ripgrep README — accurate status, clear instructions
- eza README — "Try it" concept
- Rust API Guidelines — docs should be accurate

**Tradeoffs:**
- Could add more examples, but keeping it minimal for now
- Not adding badges yet (no CI)

## Implementation

### Summary

Updated README.md to reflect the actual project state:
- Status: "Planning / Pre-development" → "M0 Complete / Active Development"
- Added Quick Start section with working commands
- Added Building from Source section
- Updated Milestones with checkmarks showing M0 completion

This is NOT a code change — its fixing misleading documentation. First impressions
